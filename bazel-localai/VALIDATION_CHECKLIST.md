# GitHub Secrets Validation Checklist

## âœ… Manual Secrets Configuration Complete!

Great job setting up your GitHub secrets manually! Here's your validation checklist:

### 1. Required Secrets Check
Go to: `https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_REPO/settings/secrets/actions`

Verify these 7 secrets are configured:
- [ ] **PROD_HOST** - Your production server IP/hostname
- [ ] **PROD_USER** - SSH username for production (e.g., 'ubuntu')
- [ ] **PROD_SSH_KEY** - SSH private key for production server
- [ ] **STAGING_HOST** - Your staging server IP/hostname  
- [ ] **STAGING_USER** - SSH username for staging (e.g., 'ubuntu')
- [ ] **STAGING_SSH_KEY** - SSH private key for staging server
- [ ] **DISCORD_WEBHOOK_URL** - Discord webhook for notifications

### 2. Test Discord Webhook
Open PowerShell and run:
```powershell
$webhook = "YOUR_DISCORD_WEBHOOK_URL"
$body = @{content="ðŸ§ª Test from Lore Engine setup"} | ConvertTo-Json
Invoke-RestMethod -Uri $webhook -Method Post -Body $body -ContentType "application/json"
```

### 3. Test SSH Access
Test connection to your servers:
```bash
ssh -i path/to/your/private/key username@your-production-server
ssh -i path/to/your/private/key username@your-staging-server
```

### 4. Ready to Deploy!
Once secrets are verified:
```bash
git push origin develop  # Deploy to staging
git push origin main     # Deploy to production
```

### 5. Monitor Deployment
- **GitHub Actions**: `https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_REPO/actions`
- **Discord**: Check your webhook channel for notifications

### 6. Success Indicators
Your deployment is working when:
- [ ] GitHub Actions workflow runs without errors
- [ ] Discord receives deployment notifications
- [ ] Applications are accessible on your servers
- [ ] Health checks pass

## ðŸŽ‰ Your Lore Engine deployment pipeline is ready to awaken!

The manual secrets configuration is complete. Your automated CI/CD pipeline will now:
