# üö® ERROR DIAGNOSIS: Bazel Not Installed

## The Problem
You're getting errors because **Bazel is not installed** on your system. This is why you're seeing:
```
bazel : The term 'bazel' is not recognized as the name of a cmdlet
```

## Quick Fix Options

### Option 1: Install via Chocolatey (Recommended)
1. Open PowerShell as Administrator
2. Install Chocolatey if not already installed:
   ```powershell
   Set-ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Scope Process -Force; [System.Net.ServicePointManager]::SecurityProtocol = [System.Net.ServicePointManager]::SecurityProtocol -bor 3072; iex ((New-Object System.Net.WebClient).DownloadString('https://community.chocolatey.org/install.ps1'))
   ```
3. Install Bazel:
   ```powershell
   choco install bazel -y
   ```

### Option 2: Download Bazelisk (Easier)
1. Go to: https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazelisk/releases
2. Download `bazelisk-windows-amd64.exe`
3. Rename it to `bazel.exe`
4. Put it in a folder in your PATH (e.g., `C:\Windows\System32`)

### Option 3: Direct Download
1. Go to: https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/releases
2. Download the latest Windows binary
3. Add it to your PATH

## After Installing Bazel

Once Bazel is installed, run these commands in your LocalAI directory:

```powershell
# 1. Update Go dependencies
go mod tidy

# 2. Generate BUILD files
bazel run //:gazelle

# 3. Build the project
bazel build //cmd/local-ai:local-ai

# 4. Test pkg/errors resolution
bazel query @com_github_pkg_errors//...
```

## Your Current Setup Status

‚úÖ **MODULE.bazel** - Properly configured with pkg/errors fix
‚úÖ **BUILD.bazel** - Correctly set up
‚úÖ **go.mod** - Contains pkg/errors as indirect dependency
‚úÖ **Go** - Installed and working
‚ùå **Bazel** - NOT INSTALLED (this is the issue!)

## The pkg/errors Solution is Ready

Once you install Bazel, the pkg/errors issue should be resolved because:
1. Your MODULE.bazel explicitly declares the pkg/errors module
2. It's included in the use_repo(...) list
3. The build files are correctly configured

Just need to install Bazel first! üöÄ
