# Test Deployment Pipeline Setup

## Branch Structure Created:
- `main` - Production deployments
- `develop` - Staging deployments

## GitHub Remote Setup Required:

### 1. Create GitHub Repository
If you haven't already, create a repository on GitHub:
1. Go to https://github.com/new
2. Repository name: `lore-engine` (or your preferred name)
3. Set to Public or Private as needed
4. Don't initialize with README (we already have content)
5. Click "Create repository"

### 2. Add Remote Origin
Replace `YOUR_USERNAME` with your GitHub username:
```bash
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/lore-engine.git
```

### 3. Push Branches
```bash
# Push main branch (production)
git push -u origin main

# Push develop branch (staging)
git push -u origin develop
```

### 4. Test the Deployment Pipeline
Once your secrets are configured and branches are pushed:

#### Test Staging Deployment:
```bash
# Make a test change
echo "Test staging deployment" > test-staging.txt
git add test-staging.txt
git commit -m "test: staging deployment"
git push origin develop
```

#### Test Production Deployment:
```bash
# Switch to main and merge develop
git checkout main
git merge develop
git push origin main
```

### 5. Monitor Deployment
- **GitHub Actions**: https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_REPO/actions
- **Discord**: Check your webhook channel for notifications

## Current Status:
‚úÖ Deployment pipeline code committed
‚úÖ Branch structure created (main, develop)
‚úÖ GitHub secrets configured manually
‚ö†Ô∏è Remote repository setup needed
‚ö†Ô∏è Initial push required

## Next Steps:
1. Create GitHub repository if not done
2. Add remote origin
3. Push both branches
4. Test deployment by pushing to develop
5. Monitor GitHub Actions and Discord for results

Your deployment pipeline is ready to go live! üöÄ
