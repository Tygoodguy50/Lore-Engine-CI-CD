# üö® Cox App Port Forwarding Still Not Working - Troubleshooting

## Current Status
- ‚úÖ **Webhook Server**: RUNNING (Process ID 9048)
- ‚úÖ **Cox App**: Configuration completed
- ‚ùå **External Access**: Still blocked (Port 443 test failed)

## üîç Possible Issues with Cox App Setup

### Issue 1: Configuration Activation Delay
Cox router changes can take **5-15 minutes** to fully activate.
- Wait 10-15 minutes after app configuration
- Router may be processing the changes in background

### Issue 2: Cox App Configuration Verification
**Double-check in Cox app:**
1. Open Cox Panoramic WiFi app
2. Go to port forwarding settings
3. Verify BOTH rules exist and are **ENABLED**:

```
Rule 1: TikTok-HTTPS
‚úÖ Status: ENABLED
Device: 192.168.0.187 (your computer)
External Port: 443
Internal Port: 443
Protocol: TCP

Rule 2: TikTok-HTTP  
‚úÖ Status: ENABLED
Device: 192.168.0.187 (your computer)
External Port: 80
Internal Port: 80
Protocol: TCP
```

### Issue 3: Device Selection in App
**Common Cox app issue**: Wrong device selected
- In Cox app, make sure you selected YOUR COMPUTER
- Look for device with IP `192.168.0.187`
- Device name might be your PC name or "Windows PC"

### Issue 4: Cox Router Restart Required
Some Cox routers need manual restart after app changes:
1. In Cox app: Look for "Restart Router" option
2. Or physically unplug router for 30 seconds, plug back in
3. Wait 5 minutes for full restart

### Issue 5: Cox Firewall/Security Settings
Cox may have additional security settings:
- In Cox app: Check "Security" or "Firewall" settings
- Look for "Gaming Mode" or "Open NAT" options
- Disable any "Attack Protection" for your computer temporarily

## üîß Quick Verification Steps

### Step 1: Re-verify Cox App Settings
1. Open Cox Panoramic WiFi app
2. Navigate to port forwarding
3. Confirm both rules are **ACTIVE/ENABLED**
4. Check device selection is correct (192.168.0.187)

### Step 2: Force Router Restart
1. In Cox app: Find "Restart Gateway" or "Reboot Router"
2. OR unplug router power for 30 seconds
3. Wait 5-10 minutes for full restart

### Step 3: Test After Restart
```powershell
Test-NetConnection -ComputerName "api.phantomgear.it.com" -Port 443
```

### Step 4: Check Windows Firewall
Windows might be blocking incoming connections:
```powershell
# Run as Administrator
New-NetFirewallRule -DisplayName "TikTok HTTPS" -Direction Inbound -Port 443 -Protocol TCP -Action Allow
New-NetFirewallRule -DisplayName "TikTok HTTP" -Direction Inbound -Port 80 -Protocol TCP -Action Allow
```

## üéØ Alternative: Cox Web Portal
If app continues to fail, try Cox website:
1. Go to: https://www.cox.com/myconnection
2. Sign in to your account  
3. Manage Panoramic WiFi gateway
4. Advanced settings ‚Üí Port forwarding
5. Add the same rules manually

## ‚ö° Working Indicators
When Cox port forwarding works, you'll see:
```
TcpTestSucceeded : True
```

## üé¨ Ready for TikTok
Once ports work, add webhook URL to TikTok:
```
https://api.phantomgear.it.com/tiktok
```

**Most likely issue: Cox app rules need manual router restart or 15-minute activation delay**
