### Step 7: Verification
After setup completes (2-3 minutes), test connectivity:
```powershell
Test-NetConnection -ComputerName "api.phantomgear.it.com" -Port 443
```

## ðŸŽ¯ Alternative: Cox Web Portal
If app doesn't work, try Cox web portal:
1. Go to: https://www.cox.com/residential/support/internet/modem-setup.html
2. Sign in to your Cox account
3. Manage your Panoramic WiFi gateway
4. Find port forwarding in advanced settings

## âš¡ After Port Forwarding is Active

### TikTok Webhook URLs to Try:
- Primary: `https://api.phantomgear.it.com/tiktok`
- Alternative: `https://api.phantomgear.it.com/webhooks/tiktok`
- HTTP Fallback: `http://api.phantomgear.it.com/tiktok`

### Verification Commands:
```powershell
# Test HTTPS
Test-NetConnection -ComputerName "api.phantomgear.it.com" -Port 443

# Test HTTP  
Test-NetConnection -ComputerName "api.phantomgear.it.com" -Port 80
```

Both should show: `TcpTestSucceeded : True`

**Once port forwarding is configured via the Cox app, TikTok webhook validation should work immediately!** ðŸš€
