## üîç Cox-Specific Issues & Solutions

### Issue 1: Cox App Rules Not Actually Applied
**Common Cox problem**: App shows rules but they're not active in router.

**Solution**: Re-verify in Cox Panoramic WiFi app:
1. Open Cox app ‚Üí Port Forwarding
2. Check if rules show as **"ACTIVE"** or **"ENABLED"**
3. If rules show but aren't active, **delete and recreate them**
4. Make sure device selection shows your computer's name/IP

### Issue 2: Cox Gateway vs Router Mode
Cox devices can be in "Gateway" mode (default) or "Router" mode.

**Check Cox app**: Look for "Bridge Mode" or "Gateway Mode" settings
- **Gateway Mode**: Cox handles routing (port forwarding through Cox app)
- **Bridge Mode**: Your own router handles it (different setup needed)

### Issue 3: Cox Security Features Blocking
Cox has additional security that can block port forwarding.

**In Cox app, check these settings:**
- **Security ‚Üí Advanced Security**: Disable temporarily
- **Firewall ‚Üí Port Blocking**: Ensure ports 80/443 not blocked
- **Attack Protection**: Disable for your computer temporarily
- **Gaming Mode**: Enable if available

### Issue 4: Cox Double-NAT Issue
Cox might have double-NAT (two layers of routing).

**Check your public IP**: 
```powershell
Invoke-WebRequest -Uri "https://api.ipify.org" -UseBasicParsing | Select-Object -ExpandProperty Content
```
If this doesn't match `70.189.130.198`, you have double-NAT.

### Issue 5: Cox Professional/Business Account Required
Some Cox residential accounts restrict port forwarding.

**Solution**: Call Cox support and ask to enable port forwarding for your account.

## üîß Alternative Solutions

### Option 1: Use Different Ports
Instead of 443/80, try high ports that Cox doesn't typically block:

**Modified TikTok server setup:**
- Run server on ports 8443/8080 instead
- Configure Cox app for 8443‚Üí8443, 8080‚Üí8080
- Update TikTok webhook URL to: `https://api.phantomgear.it.com:8443/tiktok`

### Option 2: Cox DMZ (Demilitarized Zone)
Put your computer in Cox DMZ (forwards ALL ports):

**In Cox app:**
1. Find "DMZ" or "Exposed Host" setting
2. Set DMZ host to your computer (192.168.0.187)
3. **Warning**: Less secure but bypasses port forwarding issues

### Option 3: UPnP (Universal Plug and Play)
Enable UPnP in Cox router to auto-configure ports:

**In Cox app:**
1. Find "UPnP" settings (usually in Advanced)
2. Enable UPnP
3. Restart webhook server (it may auto-configure ports)

## üéØ Immediate Action Plan

### Step 1: Verify Cox App Configuration
1. **Re-open Cox Panoramic WiFi app**
2. **Navigate to Port Forwarding**
3. **Screenshot the rules** to verify they exist and are active
4. **If rules look wrong, DELETE and recreate them**

### Step 2: Check Cox Security Settings
1. **In Cox app ‚Üí Security section**
2. **Temporarily disable Advanced Security**
3. **Check Firewall settings for port blocking**

### Step 3: Try DMZ Method (Quick Test)
1. **In Cox app, find DMZ/Exposed Host**
2. **Set to 192.168.0.187** (your computer)
3. **Test port 443 again**
4. **If it works, Cox port forwarding is broken**

### Step 4: Contact Cox Support
If nothing works: **Call Cox technical support**
- Tell them: "Port forwarding not working after configuration via Panoramic WiFi app"
- Ask them to verify port forwarding is enabled on your account
- Request escalation to technical specialist

## üé¨ TikTok Integration Status
**Server ready, just waiting for Cox router configuration to work properly.**

Once ANY external access method works, add to TikTok:
```
https://api.phantomgear.it.com/tiktok
```

**Cox routers can be tricky - the app interface sometimes has bugs where rules appear configured but aren't actually active in the router firmware.**
